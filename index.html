        <p class="lead mb-4">My familyâ€™s culture stands on the basis of respect.  It is respect of the past, of the present and of the future.  I find it in the songs that teaches me how life grows constantly and never fades and so we must nurture life.  I find it in the proverbs that shows me what I believe in, does not always mean there canâ€™t be others to learn from- of which each multifaceted, form to build a singular understanding.  In a life where I do not have my culture, I would imagine going on a path of which it is easy to stray and sway to the symphony of life.  It would be one where I lack resolve and where I cannot help but let my vast curiosity lead me astray.  With my culture, I feel more capable to stand upon solid ground even when my interest grows.  I feel more able to stand strong, remembering to rise whenever I fall, for a river that forgets its source will surely dry up.  It has helped me remember to cherish the people closest to me that hold my affection no matter what.  It helped me to be disciplined even when there are many frivolous distractions that come my way.  And so I pursue my dreams on the basis of what culture has molded and painted me into.  A hard worker and a believer.
There are days where culture comes to me in the little things such as the food and clothing.  It is an indulgence for me to say the least.  I enjoy all types of food, my curiosity leads me to try different ones in fact.  But I always come back to one of my favorite foods from my culture.  Jollof rice.  It is a specialty of Nigeria and happens to be the best food I have eaten till this day from my country.  Itâ€™s perhaps the spice, the sweetness and the smell mixed together as one.  But the memories it invokes from distant pasts and near presents makes the food so special that even in a different country, I still pine for it.  I would claim it to be a need because it has become a part of who I am.  Another way culture is in my daily life is my clothing.  I donâ€™t really make a specific determination to dress in my cultural attire, but I do love wearing it.  The beautiful mixtures of colors that are present within the designs of the native attire just makes it all the sweeter to dress in.  It also works well because those colors I use, at times, to express who I am, the season or the days.  Itâ€™s almost like a blanket to shelter me knowing I have a piece of home wherever I go.  Thereâ€™s also music.  Music has always been an integral part of culture.  It is no less true for mine.  I grew up in a culture that encouraged us to go to music classes and learn an instrument.  I myself enjoyed instrumental music but never once considered learning it until the normalization of this value forced me to pick it up.  And so I did.  Soon enough I learned my very first two instruments, which I cherish still to this day: the recorder and the flute.  As I reflected upon this particular time, I couldnâ€™t help but wonder if culture actually influenced my desire to learn this musical aspect or perhaps I already had a genuine interest in it that was just waiting to be explored.  Regardless, it has also become a part of me.
